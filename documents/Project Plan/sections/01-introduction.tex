\subsection{Background}
\label{sec:background}

The regional health care in Östergötland uses many different systems and services to keep track and get information about patients. This causes some problems since it is a time-consuming process and can, in the worst case, cause a lack of safety for the patient if the information can not get delivered in time. Patient information is documented on a paper journal that is only available for the person that happens to have the journal at the time. This also causes problems with sharing and getting the correct information. We have been tasked to digitize their journals and present all relevant information on a user-friendly application, which should be easy to use and understand. The system shall also be mobile and work with different units. The system shall also be customizable to fit the needs of people with different tasks. For more requirements, please view the requirements document.

\subsection{Goal}
