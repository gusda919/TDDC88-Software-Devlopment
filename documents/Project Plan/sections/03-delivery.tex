\section{Delivery to customer}
The system is going to be developed in four iterations that all end with a delivery to the customer. After each delivery we seek feedback and thoughts from the customer to get an idea in what direction we should continue with the project. The feedback will help us develop new or update our existing requirements. After the fourth iteration we will present the system at VSSE'21 - Valla Software and System Expo the 16th of December 2021.
