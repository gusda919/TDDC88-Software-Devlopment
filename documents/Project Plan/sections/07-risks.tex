\section{Risks}
Table \ref{tab: risk} below shows the risks we have identified for the project. They have been ranked on how significant the impact of the risk occurring would be and how likely the risk could happen. 
This table has been updated over the project by finding and adding new risks as well as changing the indicator according to changes of probability and impact over time, and the history has been recorded in Table \ref{tab: risk-history}.

\textbf{6} & Wrong time estimation & 4 & 4 & 16 & Constant communication and checking progress against schedule \\ \hline

\textbf{9} & Not meeting the external deadline & 4 & 4 & 16 & Transparent communication with the customer \\ \hline

\textbf{20} & Delay in deployment which affects acceptance testing & 4 & 4 & 16 & Assign someone to help the one who works on it \\ \hline

\textbf{4} & Not having buffer times and internal deadlines & 3 & 4 & 12 & Make sure to have internal deadlines a couple of days before the iteration ends \\ \hline

\textbf{12} & CFT dependencies & 3 & 3 & 9 & Communication between teams, weekly team leader meetings to update each other \\ \hline

\textbf{1} & Loss of code due to GitLab issues & 2 & 4 & 8 & Commit often so you can revert back if problems occur, ask if unsure when merging \\ \hline

\textbf{11} & Not reaching 160 hours & 2 & 4 & 8 & Keep tracking the time-sheet to make involve members who cannot reached the 160h in priority 4 tasks.  \\ \hline

\textbf{18} & Having a lot of failed reviews and needing to spend reworking and reprogramming issues, leading fail for deadlines & 2 & 4 & 8 & Being stricter internal deadlines so we have a buffer to the customer deadlines \\ \hline

\textbf{21} & few comments per function and a lot of commit messages not following the company guidelines which makes it difficult to maintain and understand the code & 4 & 2 & 8 & Add comments and follow the company guidelines \\ \hline

\textbf{3} & Staff sickness & 3 & 2 & 6 & Documentation for trace-ability  \\ \hline

\textbf{17} & manage to complete all the top priority issues, 1 and 2 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 1 issue per day or 5 per hour \\ \hline

\textbf{13} & Not having enough time to handle responsibilities & 2 & 2 & 4 & Splitting up the responsibilities using other staff with lower burden \\ \hline

\textbf{2} & Lack of knowledge about Angular within CFTs & 1 & 4 & 4 & Have a plan for educating ourselves in development, assess competence regularly \\ \hline

\textbf{8} & Misunderstanding in requirements & 1 & 4 & 4 & Getting feedback from the customer regularly \\ \hline

\textbf{15} & Trouble with merging & 1 & 4 & 4 & More resources, such as time \\ \hline

\textbf{19} & Trouble with deploying the product & 1 & 4 & 4 & More resources, such as time \\ \hline

\textbf{7} & Customerâ€™s new request & 1 & 3 & 3 & Getting feedback from the customer regularly \\ \hline

\textbf{14} & Long lasting branches that exist for a long time & 2 & 1 & 2 & terminate them when configuration manager decides \\ \hline

\textbf{10} & Losing critical members (ex: somebody drop the course) & 1 & 1 & 1 & CFTs and Documentation \\ \hline

\textbf{5} & Technical problems (computer stops working) & 1 & 1 & 1 & Use computer in computer lab if your computer stops working, save often \\ \hline

\textbf{16} & Zombie code (code that is old and not in use but still are on GitLab) & 1 & 1 & 1 & check compare old branch with new branch when merging, check affected files to prevent this \\ \hline

\begin{tabular}{cp{10cm}}
  \toprule
  Date & Description \\
  \midrule
  09/Nov, 2021    & 
 Risk 1: Changed probability from 4 to 2 due to implementation of pipeline and better merge request reviews 

 Risk 2: Probability changed to 1 from 4 since developers have self-studied and a workshop has been held 

 Risk 3: changed impact to 2 from 4 since we work in teams where people can take over responsibilities when someone is sick. 

 Risk 4: lower the probability since we have implemented buffer in the time plan 

 Risk 7: Lowered impact to 3 from 4 since a change from the customer is not going to affect the company too much. 

 Risk 10: The company could adapt if someone quit since we know what people are responsible for. 
    
 Added risk 11, 12, 13  \\

  11/Nov, 2021    & 
 Risk 6: Higher probability 2 to 4 since we could not meet the external deadline in iteration3 

 Risk 4: Higher probability 1 to 3 since the remained time is tight. 

 Risk 9: Higher probability 1 to 4 since we are not meeting the external deadlines. 

 Risk 11: Higher probability 1 to 2 since the developer have a short time to cover the 160 hrs. 

Added risk 14, 15,16,17,18  \\

 Risk 15: Split up into 2 different risks. The first part kept in risk 15 and the other part is added as risk 19.
