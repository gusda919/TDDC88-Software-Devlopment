\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}

The purpose of this Software Quality Assurance Plan is to establish the processes and responsibilities required to implement effective quality assurance functions for the project.

The Software Quality Assurance Plan will provide the framework necessary to ensure a consistent approach to software quality assurance throughout the project life cycle. It defines the approach that will be used by members of the company to monitor and assess software development processes to provide objective insight into the quality of the software and the product. The systematic monitoring of the product and processes will be evaluated to ensure they meet requirements. 

\subsection{Scope}
This plan covers Software Quality Assurance activities throughout the first iterations of the project and will be updated regularly.

\subsection{Project description}
The project's goal is to develop a tool that visualizes and compiles information from patients at Region Östergötland hospital's emergency departments. The information comes from the various computer systems that Region Östergötland has available today. The tool should compile information in an easy and clear way. The compiled information must be presented but does not have to include input solutions.

The product will be developed during four iterations. The project will continue until December 16, 2021, when version 1.0 will be presented.
