\section{Testing}

The Quality Coordinator will assure that the test management processes and products are being implemented per the Test Plan. This includes all types of testing of software system components as described in the test plan, specifically during integration testing (verification) and acceptance testing (validation).

The Quality Coordinator together with the Test Leader will monitor testing efforts to assure that test schedules are adhered to and maintained to reflect an accurate progression of the testing activities. It will be assured that tests are conducted using approved test procedures and appropriate test tools, and that test anomalies are identified, documented, addressed, and tracked to closure.

Members of the Test Team will review post-test execution related artifacts including test results and test reports.

\subsection{Purpose}

Testing is an important part of the work to ensure that the requirements are complied with and thus assuring quality.
