\subsection{Plan to monitor documents}
The document guidelines can be found in section 5 of the \href{https://gitlab.liu.se/tddc88-company-1-2021/deploy/-/tree/develop/documents/Project\%20Plan}{Project Plan}. The guidelines cover the process of updating and reviewing the content in the regulatory documents. This procedure is done as an internal inspection before each new published version of a regulatory document to ensure quality. Beside these guidelines, the Quality Coordinator shall monitor the regulatory documents and make sure their structure follow the company guidelines. This will be done every iteration.
%The main reviewers for each document will check if the document specific guidelines are followed and if essential content is missing. Remarks from the review is left as comments in the document editor and after the review is over, the reviewer sends a summary of the review to the author of the latest version of the document. This producedure is done as an internal inspection before each new published version of a regulatory document.
