\section{Product \& Sales}
\label{sec:pands}

The Product \& Sales department consists of three smaller groups of people with more focused work, which are the analysts, the testers and the quality assurance and their education plan is described below.

\subsection{Analysts}
At the start of the project, the analysts will gather requirements about the product we will create. They will also make user stories and use cases to better explain what the product will do. To get the right knowledge about this, their education is based on what we learn in the lectures given in this course about these topics. The lab series in the course also has a lab regarding this topic, which will also be used to gain knowledge.


\subsection{Testers}
Testers are responsible to test the product to make sure it works as intended. They will start to learn about testing by studying the course material presented in lectures and labs to get a basic understnading about what their role is responsible for.


\subsection{Quality}
Quality is responsible for ensuring that the product fulfills the quality standards we have put on it. How this will be done is not yet decided, but he lecture about software quality could be a good start for the education in quality.
