\section{Communication}
\label{sec:communication}

In our organization we are using a few tools to help us communicate between each other. The main tool is Microsoft Teams, where communication is handled in channels. The main channel is used for company wide information and meetings and also as the main place to store files, while smaller teams have their own channels where more specific information is shared. Everyone has access to every channel to make the information as transparent as possible.

For structuring our work we are using Trello to create Kanban-boards. Task are put up on the list and people can either assign themselves or be assigned to a task to work on, which is a concept everyone is familiar with. No education is needed for these communication tools since everyone is already familiar with them.
